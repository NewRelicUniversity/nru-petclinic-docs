Using the Pet Clinic Sample Application
===========================================

New Relic's APM training includes a hands-on lab, in which students practice using APM to troubleshoot an application performance problem. We typically use the [Spring Pet Clinic sample application](https://github.com/NewRelicUniversity/spring-petclinic) for this exercise; the application has a memory leak which causes it to perform poorly under load. 

This document describes how to deploy the sample application, how to generate traffic to the app, and how to stress the application so that it exhibits the performance problem.
